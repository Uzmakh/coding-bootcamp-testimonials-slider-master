# Frontend Mentor - Coding bootcamp testimonials slider solution

This is a solution to the [Coding bootcamp testimonials slider challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coding-bootcamp-testimonials-slider-4FNyLA8JL). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

    ### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

  ### Layout

The designs are created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px
  These are just the design sizes. However the design overall is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

The colors(in :root selector) and Typography(font-family, font-size, font-weight) are included in the style.css file
